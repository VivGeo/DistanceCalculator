# DistanceCalculator
This calculates the distance between two cities, using the geo-coordinates from the city's Wikipedia page and haversine's formula, borrowed from Rosetta Code.

For popular, well known cities, such as Toronto, Moscow or Beijing, entering the city name alone is fine.

For less well known cities or ambiguous choices (e.g. Markham), eliminating ambiguity by writing which state or province the city is from (e.g. Markham, Ontario vs Markham, Illinois) is required.

If ambiguous choice is entered, a list of cities to choose from is given.
